- 0/1 Knapsack. Choosing a subset of items such that we maximize their total value and their total weight does not exceed the capacity of the container

https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_d
Solution: dp[weight]: the value that have weight exactly weight

https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_e(same as above but bigger constraints)
Solution: dp[value]: the min weight that takes up exactly value

Coin change: The min number of coins that can change for a value X(1 coin can select multiple time)
