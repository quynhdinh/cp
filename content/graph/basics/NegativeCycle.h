/**
Explanation:
If we follow the links back from t.f.s then we must always enter a cycle.
Otherwise, this would contradict the assumption that there exists a shorter
path to t.f.s when considering paths of arbitrary length than those of
length at most n-1. The sum of the edge weights along this path is
non-positive, and it can't be zero because then it would have no origin ...
